# goType - its my personal project.. soon will be available to download on npm. 
the project i built from nothing till pruduction, using typescript, react, lerna package manager, esBuild and more.
hope you'de like it.

goType is a platform that enables users to use the cli and write a simple command that automaticly will open in the local browser, 
at a given port that you'll choose. 
and inside the platform you are able to write jsx code that you'll see the result immidietly at a frame neer the text editor.
you can take notes about you're progress and save everything in youre local machine...


this platform is similar to codeSandbox only it's bundle by esBuild, a much faster bundler tool to bundle code from many languages to js that compiles to 
your browser.. you are able to download at the text editor any package that published on npm and only import it direcly from the browser.
like all the packages of npm are allready in your computer once you use this platform and that can save you a lot of time because you dont need to think
a lot about which package to download that would make trouble in your app.. simply import it immidietly in goType,
try it and decide weather or not to use it in you next project.
